        * mplapack 2.0.1 integration
        * catch up to recent compilers and autotools.

2015-03-20 Makoto Yamashita <Makoto.Yamashita@is.titech.ac.jp>
        * Modification for the latest gcc compilers.

2009-10-05 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>
        * mpack 0.5.1 integration.

2009-09-28 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>
        * read sufficiently large precision (reported by Henry Cohn)

2009-02-12 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>
        * Allow link against external mpack.
          ./configure --with-system-mpack
        * Now sdpa_gmp is statically linked which is faster except for MacOSX [1].

2009-02-02 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>
        * migrate to mpack for linear algebra part. Just take routines.

        * Fix a bug in gmp_dsterf [1]
        * remove mpf_abs_

        * peep hole speedup for gmp_sign
        * add mBSD header to sdpa_gmpalgebra.cpp

2008-07-31 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>
        * better implementation of gmp_dlamchE; once it has calculated,
          then saves the value.
        * better implementation of gmp_dlamchS by using mp_limb_t.
          2^31-1 for exponent for i386 machines. still it does not seem 
          to be correct. 2^122 seems to be the right number, but not 
          consistent with the manual [manual says: 
	  2^-68719476768 to 2^68719476736; which are about 2^36-1 to 2^36-1]
        * peep hole speedup for gmp_sign

        * Catch up to SDPA 7.1.1, and updated accordingly.
	* Fix floating point error during the calculation.
          This was due to passing 0.0 to double log10().
          It happens when the "digits" of sdpa_io.cpp is very small
          so that it becomes zero when converted to double from mpf_class.
        * Correct implementation for quicksort of eigenvalues. 

         Reported by "Hayato Waki" <hayato.waki@jsb.cs.uec.ac.jp>

	* Fix DIMACS_ERROS -> DIMACS_ERRORS.

2008-06-13 Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>

	* Use P_FORMAT instead of GMP_P_FORMAT. Accordance with the manual. 
        * Fix DIMACS print build and correctly output DIMACS error 
             to the result file [2].
        * remove param.sdpa~

        * 7.0.5 RC2
        * Many clean ups.

2008-02-09  Fujisawa Katsuki

        * 7.0.5 RC1
	* sdpa_main.cpp KAPPA value has been changed to 1.2
	-static double KAPPA = 1.0;
	+static double KAPPA = 1.2;
        * remove some warnings

2007-12-11  Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>

        * Catch up to 7.0.5 of double version.

2007-09-16 Kazuhide Nakata 

	* Modify stopping criteria and step length.
	* Add SolveInfo::check (print various information of current point)

2007-06-29  Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>

        * Remove GPL.txt. COPYING is newer and better.
        * Update to 7.0.2. Fixes of memory leaks from Kazuhide Nakata.
        * better configure.in, Makefile.am.

        * Remove sdpa_dpotrf.h, sdpa_dpotrf.cpp, sdpa_linear.h, sdpa_linear.cpp.
          We do not need them since we use GNU Multi Precision.

2007-06-25  Nakata Maho <maho@riken.jp>

        * Rewrite for gmp version.
